[b]Section 3 - Potential Proposals[/b]

[b]1.[/b] If a Councillor wants to propose legistlation they are encouraged to create a thread in Potiential Proposals.
[b]2.[/b] New proposals may consist of only an idea or may already contain the first draft of the proposed legistlation.
[b]3.[/b] Councillors are encouraged to help develop the ideas in this sub-board into a legistlative text that reflects the intent of the creator of the thread.
[b]4.[/b] Potential Proposals is not a place for substantive discussion, only for aiding Councillors in creating well-formed proposals.

[b]Section 4 - The Desk of the Speaker[/b]

[b]1.[/b] Councillors may submit proposals that adhere to the formatting rules to the Desk of the Speaker by creating a new thread in this sub-board.

[b]Section 5 - Council Chamber (Proposals)[/b]

[b]1.[/b] The Speaker will move Proposals from the Desk of the Speaker into the Council Chamber by creating a new thread in this sub-board containing the identification number, the text, the name of the submitting Councillors of the Proposal, and a poll on the adoption of the Proposal (as amended, if applicable) with the answer options "Yea", "Nay", and "N/A" (indicating Not Voting or Absent").
[b]2.[/b] Councillors may not post in Council Chamber threads.
[b]3.[/b] Once a Proposal has been moved into the Council Chamber, it is automatically referred to the Committee of the Whole.

[b]2.[/b] Councillors may discuss the Proposal freely in the Committee of the Whole.
[b]3.[/b] The Speaker should only moderate the Committee of the Whole if needed to keep the discussion civilized and to ensure that all Councillors can express their opinions.
[b]4.[/b] Once the Proposal has been developed to the satisfaction of the Commitee of the Whole it will rise so that a vote can be held on the Proposal.
[b]5.[/b] When the Committee of the Whole has risen, Councillors must not post to the Committee of the Whole until the Speaker posts the next Proposal.
[b]6.[/b] If the Committee of the Whole can not agree on the final version of a Proposal to be voted on, each Councillor may submit one Amendment with all proposed changes to the Desk of the Speaker. Amendment Proposals must reference the identification number of the original Proposal.

[b]Section 7 - Council Chamber (Votes)[/b]

[b]1.[/b] Once the Committee of the Whole rose, the Speaker will organize the vote on the Proposal.
[b]2.[/b] If no Proposal Amendments were submitted, the Speaker starts the vote on the adoption of the Proposal.
[b]3.[/b] If any Proposal Amendments have been submitted, they must first be voted on in separate threads.
[b]4.[/b] Threads for votes on Proposal Amendments will contain the text of the Proposal (as previously amended, if applicable), its identification number, and the names of the submitting Councillors.
[b]5.[/b] If all Proposal Amendments have been voted on, the Proposal will be voted on as amended.
[b]6.[/b] Voting will start at the time the Speaker indicates this with a post.
[b]7.[/b] Voting will be closed after forty eight hours have elapsed from its start, or as soon as possible thereafter. This closing may be done by the Speaker of the Administrators.

[b]Section 8 - Law Library[/b]

[b]1.[/b] The Law Library is managed by the Speaker and the Administrators. Other Councillors may not post or create threads in it.
[b]2.[/b] If a Proposal is passed, it takes on the name it specified in accordance with the formatting rules and its text is added in a new thread to the appropriate sub-boards of the Law Library with all relevant identification numbers, names, and dates.
[b]3.[/b] Bills passed will be issued a new identification number by the Speaker according to the following scheme: "D.C.
