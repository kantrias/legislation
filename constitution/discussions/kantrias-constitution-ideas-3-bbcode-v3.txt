[div]So, like Cal said on Discord, it seems that we are getting close to agreement on substantive questions.[/div]
[div]Therefore I made a draft with the structural and wording changes that I wanted to propose.[/div]
[div]Some notes on structure:
[/div][div][ul type="disc"][li]Notably, I moved the regularity part of the elections to the respective Officers, but left the part that is the same for everyone separate. I view this as the best and most clear option.[/li][li]Also notably, I moved supremacy, modification and adoption to the end, where it I think (and usually) belongs.
[/li][li]Shifted around clauses between sections and also some parts between clauses, but content-wise - except the (hopefully complete) list of exceptions below - it should be the same, and in some places clarified with the meaning we have discussed so far.
[/li][/ul][/div]
[div]Things that were changed in content:
[/div][ul type="disc"][li]Removed the part of modifications being edited in, that is covered by "modify" instead of "amend" (Art. 1 Sec. 1 Cl. 5 of prev.)[/li][li]For establishment of the Constitution I added adoption by vote, but by the Residents, not the Councillors, which would not exist prior to this, so technically the vote should be done in the Region, with all Residents allowed to participate to be valid. For practical reasons we might not do this, but I think it should "officially" be like this anyway.
[/li][li]Applied more clearer consistency to terms used.[/li][li]Made the multiple account case more clear. It was implied in the prev. draft that someone can have multiple accounts, just not with Councillor status, so I went with that.[/li][li]Changed a lot of the verbs to be closer to the intended meaning. In some cases to maintain present tense (which is recommended).[/li][li]The Delphinium Council drafts, it is Councillors who propose (as per the Rules).[/li][li]Added 2/3 requirement to declarations of war.[/li][li]I differentiated between bills and resolutions for better flexibility and added the relation of them to treaties and executive orders.[/li][li]I changed the SC's "reserves the privilege of proposing treaties" to more standard language. For one, in the last draft we added DC creation right, which contradicts with "reserve" if we mean right, but privilege is a subjective thing that is not the right for the context anyway.[/li][li][EDIT: I forgot two:] I added a week long period between constitution modification bills being introduced and passed.[/li][li]The Supreme Chancellor breaks ties in second round voting.[/li][/ul]
[div]EDIT:[/div][div][ul type="disc"][li]Changed Art. 5. Sec. 1. Cl. 4-5. based on Liana's comments.[/li][li]Changed Art. 5. Sec. 2. Cl. 3. based on Liana's comments.
